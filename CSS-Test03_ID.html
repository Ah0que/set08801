    <h1>The Negro Speaks of Rivers</h1>
    <h2>By Langston Hughes</h2>
    <p class="first">
        I’ve known rivers:
I’ve known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow of human blood in human veins.
</p>

<p class="second"></p>My soul has grown deep like the rivers.</body></html></p>
<p class="third">
I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young.<br>
I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep.<br>
I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it.<br>
I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln went<br> 
down to New Orleans, and I’ve seen its muddy bosom turn all golden in the sunset.<br>
</p>
<p class="fourth">
I’ve known rivers:
Ancient, dusky rivers.
</p>
<p class=" "fifth">
My soul has grown deep like the rivers.
</p>
