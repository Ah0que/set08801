        <h1>From My Heart</h1>
        <h2>by  Mrs. Creeves</h2> 
        <p>A million stars up in the sky.<br>
            One shines brighter - I can't deny.<br>
            A love so precious, a love so true,<br>
            a love that comes from me to you.<br>
            The angels sing when you are near.<br>
            Within your arms I have nothing to fear.<br>
            You always know just what to say.<br>
            Just talking to you makes my day.<br>
            I love you, honey, with all of my heart.<br>
            Together forever and never to part.<br>
            
        </p>
